Simple bash administration scripts for Linux to make your life easier.

Scripts Available:

##FTP Backup Script 
For any linux server which backs up critical system files and folders and also all your MySQL Databases.
The script uses the NCFTP client, it deletes backups older than X days and also emails you with a
success or failure message. I wrote this 5 years ago and it works like a charm and has saved my shiny
white hiney on a few occasions.
